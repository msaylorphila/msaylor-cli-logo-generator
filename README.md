## Installation

Prerequisities for this project include node and npm. Clone this repository and open the package.json filed in the integrated terminal and run an npm install. This will install both inquirer and jest for later testing.

## Usage

This app works by taking in questions from inquirer and creating user prompts.

We then take the responses shared and feed them to a shape parent class, then further to circle, square, and triangle shape children classes to render a svg file.
